           <p class="text-left">Since its <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/company">creation</a> in 2012, Peloton's stationary bike and all-access membership have revolutionized the fitness world.

           <p class="text-left">&nbsp;Three main features were considered to identify the target audience for the persuasion campaign – geographic, demographic, and psychographic characteristics. This target audience comprises busy businesspeople and or parents, both men and women, ages 18 and older, who live in the United States. Audience A is educated, well-informed, and in the moderate to high-income bracket. According to ELM, for central processing to work, both elaboration motivation and ability have to be present <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1002/9781405186407.wbiece011.pub2">(O’Keefe, 2013)</a>. This group enjoys working out, being healthy, and sees fitness as a lifestyle as well as a way to keep control of their ever-changing world. The simple act of clipping into their bike whenever convenient is extremely appealing to them.</p>

           <p class="text-center text-capitalize"><strong>Persuasion Theory</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-left">Two theories are significantly applicable to central processing persuasion. Theory of Reasoned Action suggests the combination of attitude and subjective norms of the recipient of a message determine behavior <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781405186407.wbiecr017">(Fishbein 2008)</a>. Peloton’s website strategy keeps its message positive and motivating to provide immediate options, keeping the customer’s attitude confident and optimistic. Subjective norms can also be addressed by the support members and inspirational instructors provide with the all-access membership. Framing theory also advances the central persuasion objective by being selective and deliberate with the frames utilized throughout this website <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781405186407.wbiecf039.pub2">(Scheufele, 2008)</a>. The idea is to persuade the target audience with central processing techniques focusing on a logical and informative argument. &nbsp;</p>

           <p class="text-left">&nbsp;Peloton’s website reflects its products and company’s core values with a simple, clean, sophisticated, yet impactful and attractive look. The website's photographs and links are clear and informative, which according to <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Multimedia_Foundations/XP4QDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Costello,+V.+(2016).+Multimedia+foundations:+Core+concepts+for+digital+design.+CRC+Press.&pg=PP1&printsec=frontcover">Costello (2017)</a>, is necessary to explain what the website offers. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-non-designers-presentation/9780321679055/pt03.html">Williams (2015)</a> also reiterates that the four basic design principles (contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity, C.R.A.P.) can improve one’s work and immediately offer a more professional and appealing look. For these reasons, these main concepts were applied throughout the website. The design provides a clear contrast in color with the recognizable red P knob, black and white background, and Peloton written in capital letters. Repetition and alignment are seen with primarily red, white, and black colors placed in strategic and settle ways. The overall Peloton campaign design reflects simplicity and organization to provide a clear focus for the customer’s attention.</p>
